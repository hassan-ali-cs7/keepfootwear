        <p>Footwear Business is one of the most profitable businesses. To get the most out of your footwear business,
          try to avoid the following mistakes</p><br />


        <h3 align="center"><strong>NOT DIFFERENTIATING ITSELF FROM COMPETITORS</strong></h3><br />

        <p>The Footwear Shop should distinguish and stand out from the competitors by focusing on the distinguishing
          factors of your products. The distinguishing factor could be the quality of the leather or designs of the
          shoes. These distinguishing factors can also help in determining and justifying the price of your product.</p>
        <br />

        <h3 align="center"><strong>MAKE FOOTWEARS EITHER OVERPRICED OR UNDERPRICED</strong></h3><br />

        <p>Some Footwear Businesses assume that overpricing their product will make them prominent in front of the
          customers. It doesn’t work always. Eventually, when a customer get to know about your competitors, the
          customer will understand and determine the actual cost of the product. Similarly underpricing the shoe product
          will induce a sense of skepticism in your customers.</p><br />


        <h3 align="center"><strong>HIRE COURTEOUS STAFF INSTEAD OF MORE KNOWLEDGEABLE STAFF</strong></h3><br />

        <p>Having courteous staff can help in increasing the sales. It is the Courtesy of the staff that will make the
          customer return to the shop to purchase again. Although staff should have knowledge about the footwear
          products but it’s the courtesy and good manners that will lead to more sales.</p><br />

        <h3 align="center"><strong>Not Doing Marketing Effectively</strong></h3><br />

        <p>In this online era, when customer wants to look for a shoe store, he searches it online. If you search “shoe
          stores in <i>your-local-area</i>” on google, It will display the top 3 footwear stores in your local area.</p>
        <p>
          Your shoe store should be displayed in these top 3 results with the correct name, address, phone number. It
          takes time to get ranked in the top 3. SEO service providers or digital marketing agencies like
          keepfootwear.com can help you in this ranking
        </p>

        <h3 align="center"><strong>Not Having A Website</strong></h3><br />

        <p>Today the online appearance counts a lot and having a website can boost your online appearance. It is not mandatory to have a fancy website or having an online selling/purchasing mechanism. The website could be a simple one-pager, consisting :-</p>
        <ul>
          <li>distinguishing factors of the Shoe Store</li>
          <li>customer reviews</li>
          <li>good pictures of some of your products</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The first benefit of having a website is that it will portray your shoe store as a legitimate business. Secondly, having a website is a basic necessity for performing SEO.

            <p>The Footwear industry is one of the most profitable industries. The Revenue generated by this industry is about US$109,690m in 2019. According to <a href="https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/footwear-market">this report</a>, this revenue will be increased in the upcoming years and online mode-of-sale in this industry is going to play an important role. So, footwear businesses should focus on their online presence also in the upcoming years.</p><br />
            <p>There are a lot of benefits of creating an online presence of your footwear business. Firstly, it increases your sales by giving access to more potential customers than you currently have. Secondly, It gives you freedom for e.g you can spend more time with your family/friends and can go anywhere while the customers can still view and place orders online.</p><br />
            <p>So, now you have decided to grow your footwear business online. But there are already competitors online in this industry then how could you stand out and capture the online market. Here are five ways that can help you increase your footwear business online.</p><br />


            <h3 align="center"><strong>BUILD CUSTOMER TRUST IN ONLINE SHOPPING</strong></h3><br />
                <p><img src="images/article-increase-profit-build-trust.jpg" alt="coffee-shop-marketing" class="img-responsive" /></p>

            <p>Even in this online era, the customer still wants to know about some sort of physical appearance of a company. Before purchasing, they want to trust that they are dealing with a company that has some appearance. So, to build this customer trust you should have an "About Us" page on your online website which shows a brief history of your company. Adding the google-map location and uploading pictures of your warehouse/products can also build this trust. So you can get more customers by making them believe in your existence.</p><br />

            <h3 align="center"><strong>RANK THE WEBSITE HIGHER ON GOOGLE</strong></h3><br />
                  <p><img src="images/article-increase-profit-SEO.jpg" alt="coffee-shop-marketing-company" class="img-responsive" /></p>

            <p>If a user wants to purchase footwear, the first thing he does is to visit google.com and search that product. So, in order to capture more customers, you have to make your website appear in the top 2 results when a user searches for footwear (the type of footwear you deal in/target audience). This type of online marketing is called Search Engine Marketing (SEM). Now there are different methods/tools that can be used to do SEM effectively for e.g Search Engine Optimization, Adwords, etc. These techniques help your website rank higher on google.</p><br />


            <h3 align="center"><strong>KEEP IN TOUCH WITH YOUR EXISTING CUSTOMERS</strong></h3><br />
                  <p><img src="images/article-increase-profit-email-marketing.jpg" alt="maximize-your-coffee-shops-profit" class="img-responsive" /></p>


            <p>Your existing customers are the assets for your company. You should make them realize that your company haven't forgotten them. Email Marketing caters this. Now there are many online tools available through which email marketing can be implemented. The essence of this strategy is that you should send information regarding discounted items, new arrivals and other promotions at least weekly via email (automated tools), so that your existing customers keep visiting your webiste.</p><br />

            <h3 align="center"><strong>CONVERSION RATE OPTIMIZATION (CRO)</strong></h3><br />
                  <p><img src="images/article-increase-profit-conversion-optimization.jpg" alt="maximize-your-coffee-shops-profit" class="img-responsive" /></p>


            <p>What does conversion Rate mean. Conversion Rate means the percentage of online vistors that actually converted into customers. You should keep an eye on your online traffic to optimize your conversion rate. For e.g You have realized that a lot of traffic to your website is coming from mobile-phones, then your website design layout should be mobile friendly. You should also keep on tweaking your website design to get an idea of which design increases the conversion rate. A/B Testing is one of the technique for CRO.</p><br />

            <h3 align="center"><strong>SOCIAL MEDIA</strong></h3><br />
                  <p><img src="images/article-increase-profit-social-media.jpg" alt="maximize-your-coffee-shops-profit" class="img-responsive" /></p>


            <p>After Google-Search, social media platforms (Facebook, instagram etc) are the channels where user looks for the products and product-recommendations. So there should be an "active" facebook-page or instagram-page for your company. This page should posts new-arrival items, memes, interactive questions etc regarding your product to make visitor understand that we are "active" in this bussiness.</p>
